  <h1>Web Project Grading Matrix</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
  <p>All six course objectives will be assessed in the Web Project. Each objective is valued at 30 points. The specifications listed below apply to all project pages including the planning and homework pages.</p>

  <h2>Objective 1</h2>
  <p><strong>10 points</strong> - All web pages use semantic elements for page and content structures (remember that div and span elements should be used only as a last resort, when no other semantic element is available). 2 points will be deducted for each missing semantic element.</p>

  <p><strong>10 points</strong> - All web pages are valid HTML5. 2 points will be deducted for each validation error found by the HTML5 validator.</p>

  <p><strong>5 points</strong> - All folders and files (web pages, images, videos, javascript, json, css and any other site file) follow the web naming rules.&nbsp;2 points will be deducted for each naming rule error found in the site.</p>

  <p><strong>5 points</strong> - All web pages have meaningful, content-related titles.&nbsp;2 points will be deducted for each missing or non-content specific title found for each page.</p>

  <h2>Objective 2</h2>
  <p><strong>10 points</strong> - All pages are valid CSS3. 2 points will be deducted for each validation error found by the CSS validator.</p>
  <p><strong>5 points</strong> - All CSS must be written and applied to the site using external CSS pages. 5 points will be deducted if any internal or inline css code is found.</p>
  <p><strong>10 points</strong> - Media queries are appropriately used to change content layouts for large, medium and small screens. Appropriateness will be determined by comparing screen layouts to the wireframe sketches in your planning document (e.g. do your screens match your sketches?). 4 points will be deducted for each mis-match or non-responsive layout per screen size up to the maximum of 10 points.</p>
  <p><strong>5 points</strong> - No horizontal scrolling or zooming will be required to view content, on any screen size. All or nothing score, if any content requires horizontal scrolling or zooming to view the content, all 5 points will be deducted. (This does not apply for content that scrolls within a container in order to display a sequential series of values, but should NOT apply to the entire page).</p>

  <h2>Objective 3</h2>
  <p><strong>5 points</strong> - One project page will be randomly checked for implementation of usability principles as identified in the Usability Checklist (focusing on the five considered to be "low hanging fruit"). 1 point will be deducted for each missing usability concept.</p>
  <p><strong>5 points</strong> - One project page will be randomly checked for page weight. The uncached weight must be equal to or less than 400k. 5 points will be deducted if the weight is greater than 400k.</p>
  <p><strong>5 points</strong> - Site images must be optimized and delivered using responsive media techniques appropriate to screen size and/or density and operating environment. One page will be randomly checked across devices for optimization and adaptability of images to the device. 5 points will be deducted if images do not adapt and change by device type.</p>
  <p><strong>5 points</strong> - At least one content-related video of your own creation must be present in the site using the HTML5 video element. The video must play in all major browsers and on small, medium and large screened devices. 5 points will be deducted if the video is missing or does not play in a browser or on a device.</p>
  <p><strong>5 points</strong> - The PARC and typography design principles must be found applied to the style of your project site. 1 point will be deducted for each missing design principal.</p>
  <p><strong>5 points</strong> - The visual appearance must be uniform and consistent across the project site. 5 points will be deducted if one of the project site pages does not follow the visual appearance of other pages in the site.</p>

  <h2>Objective 4</h2>
  <p><strong>5 points</strong> - A link to the planning document must be found in the footer of all project web pages. 1 point will be deducted if the link is found missing from any project site page footer.</p>
  <p><strong>10 points</strong> - A planning document describing the site purpose, the target audience, an appropriate persona and wireframe sketches for three screen sizes (small, medium and large) is provided.<strong> The planning document will also indicate the following: 1) which pages use JSON data and 2) which page contains the HTML5 video.</strong> 3 points will be deducted for each missing element, up to the maximum of 10 points.</p>
  <p><strong>5 points</strong> - A link to the homework document must be found in the footer of all project web pages. 1 point will be deducted if the link is found missing from any project site page footer.</p>
  <p><strong>5 points</strong> - JavaScript modularization is used to provide common content (e.g. header, navigation, footer) to project site pages. 5 points will be deducted for any page found not using this methodology.</p>
  <p><strong>5 points</strong> - Navigation must be fully operational and adapt to screen size and all links must work. 5 points will be deducted for any navigation item that does not work or if navigation fails to adapt as screen sizes change.</p>

  <h2>Objective 5</h2>
  <p><strong>15 points</strong> - JSON data (of your own creation) must be used as the primary content of at least two project site pages. The JSON object must be displayed in the console of the developer tools within the browser. Navigate to one of the JSON content pages. Click the console tab in the developer tools, the json object should be visible. Expand it and examine the object values. Is the object visible? Does it apper to be JSON? Deduct 15 points if any aspect of this requirements is not met.</p>

  <p><strong>15 points</strong> JSON data must be inserted using JavaScript and/or JQuery. Other uses of JavaScript and/or jQuery are encouraged to enhance the user experience. While still looking at the JSON object(s) in the console window, look at the rendered page in the browser view. Does the data in the JSON object appear in the page view? Deduct 15 points if the data in the JSON object is not obviously represented in the page view (you may have to scroll to view data).</p>

  <h2>Objective 6</h2>
  <p><strong>10 points</strong> - The project site must have a minimum of five content pages (excluding the planning and homework pages). 10 points will be deducted if less than 5 content pages are found in the project site.</p>

  <p><strong>10 points</strong> - The finished project site must be ready by the due date. The project must be the main content of your hosted web site. All previous assessments should be located via a homework link in the site footer. This will be determined by clicking the link to your site in the Student Site List. The project should now be visible without any additional navigation. <strong>If the project is not found as described, 100% of the project points described in this grading matrix will be deducted - all of them.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>10 points</strong> - The project explanation video is present in the homework page. The video meets the requirements listed in the <a href="requirements.html" title="Review the Web Project requirements" target="_blank">Web Project</a> document. 10 points will be deducted if the video is not found or if the link is missing or does not work. 5 points will be deducted for each missing part of the requirements listed in the Course Project document, up to the maximum of 10 points.</p>
