        <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this site is to provide basic information about what the weather is like at the moment, what it has been like, and what it may be like in the future at a glance so that people can plan their outdoor activities, transportation, and clothing decisions accordingly. People should be able to find out ahead of time whether they will need a jacket, an umbrella, a windshield scrapper, snow chains, a different way to get to their destination, or a different flight.</p>

        <h2>Peer Review</h2>
        <p>Samantha Sullivan reviewed my document and said that the organization looked okay, but there was no way to tell what any of the elements were for or what information was being presented on my wireframe sketches. I changed all of my sketches to include more details also realized that I wasn't using the space of the bigger screens, so I rearranged some of the elements and added some more information that wouldn't fit on the smaller screens.</p>
