        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
        <p>The demographics of this site are anyone. They could be people that want to see a movie in a theater, or people that want to know more about the movie that they are being forced to watch on netflix by their girlfriend.</p>
        <p>The site met the needs of the visitor by making the most commons tools prominent on the front page without having to scroll, like the search function, the trailers, and the theater showtimes.</p>
        <p>The content was organized from top to bottom in blocks. The search box was at the top. The new trailers were arranged horizontally in their own block below the search tool, and the link to the showtimes was in its own block, all of different colors</p>
        <p>The site seemed to facilitate people in a mobile environment, because they were able to offer a lot of features in a small space without it seeming cramped. It doesn't take many clicks to get information fast if you are on the go, or to start casually browsing.</p>
