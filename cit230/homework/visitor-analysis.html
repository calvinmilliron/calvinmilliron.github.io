        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
        <p>The demographics of this site could be almost anyone. It could be someone who loves old movies and wants to know more about them, it could be someone who loves new movies and wants to see the latest trailers, but it could be someone who doesn’t care for movies, but is dating someone who does and needs to know what they are getting into.</p>
        <p>This site meets the needs of its visitor by providing clear and concise ways to access different types of information directly from the home page using the small space of a mobile screen effectively and with as few clicks as possible.</p>
        <p>The content was organized to provide focus to different functions for people looking for different things. The site provides a clear and separated search function, as well as separate section for new trailers, and recent news articles.</p>
        <p>This site made the mobile experience less painful by arranging all of the content to fit inside the size of the mobile device’s screen without the need to zoom to properly see any of the content. </p>
        <p>This site seems to facilitate people in a mobile environment by not requiring any part of the site to be zoomed in or out. This site uses color contrasts to define different parts of the site, knowing that on a small screen it is much more likely for content to blur together.</p>

        <p>They did not know their target audience. There was no clear information provided on the home screen. The only section that has a clear purpose is the bar at the top that provides nothing, but a menu icon and a search icon.</p>
        <p>They did not meet the needs of their audience. They did not provide any information that their audience may have been interested in without first searching for something.</p>
        <p>The content that was provided by this website was not organized to facilitate it being found and was difficult to identify because it was surrounded by advertisements and unrelated news articles.</p>
        <p>The site facilitated visitors in a mobile environment because it was scaled to fill the mobile screen without the ability to zoom in or out, but the desired content was unavailable without using the search function, multiple clicks, and much scrolling.</p>
