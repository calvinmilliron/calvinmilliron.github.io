      <h3>Project Proposal</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Project Purpose</h4>
        <p>This project will introduce each of my children. It will provide the user with updated information about the personalities of each of my children as they grow and evolve, as well as current events in their lives.</p>
        <h4>The Audience</h4>
        <p>The audience will be friends and family who are interested in the growth and development of my children, but are no longer able to watch them grow since we moved away to Idaho for me to go to school.</p>
        <p>The demographics vary greatly. The visitor could be a homemaker staying home with small children who want to see a recent picture of their nieces and nephew. They might even show the picture to their small child and read the child information about their cousin and how they are doing in Idaho. The visitor could also be an uncle or grandfather looking up information about their grandkids at work, or a teenage cousin looking up information about their cousin while at school.</p>
        <p>The site meets the needs of the Visitor by showing them the introduction video first as it is the most personal media available before listing current information and showing recent photos.</p>
        <p>The site will be adjusted for the mobile experience by only showing the video above the fold so that if that is the only thing a mobile visitor sees, they will be satisfied with the most descriptive piece of information.</p>

        <h4>Usability Concepts</h4>
        <p>I will adjust font sizes to make it easier to read on different devices, apply appropriate ALT tags to every image, make interactive elements consistent and apparent, include clear and descriptive headings, and clear and concise main copy.</p>
